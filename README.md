# assessment: Repo creation and pushing

*This is a description of the steps taken to create this repo*

1. Firstly, I created a GitHub repository named **Assessment1** with a **README.md file**
2. Created two branches under the repository, **main** and **Sub branch**
3. Got the **https** link of the repository from the "code" icon and directly cloned it in my local machine via VS Code
4. Created **index.html**, **gallery.css** and **gallery.js** files
5. Downloaded my images from unsplash.com
6. Created the image gallery in my HTML file and styled it in the CSS file
7. Cross-checked it with the live server extension in VS code
8. Went to the "source control" section and used the **commit and push** function while inputting a message describing the commit.
